# MultiSpawn
Multiple spawnpoints per world!

This Minecraft Spigot/Bukkit/Paper plugin will teleport a player to the spawnpoint they're closest to.

Useful if you want players to respawn at the closest hospital when they die, or an easy way to teleport them to the closest viewing area in an arena upon death!
